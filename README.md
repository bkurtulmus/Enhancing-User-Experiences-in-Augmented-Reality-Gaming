# Enhancing User Experiences in Augmented Reality Gaming

This repository contains the source code and files for my Augmented Reality (AR) game project, developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course. The project focuses on improving user experience, comfort, and immersion in AR gaming through iterative usability testing and design refinements.

## Project Overview

The game immerses players in an AR environment, where they interact with digital elements overlaid on the real world. Usability tests were conducted with diverse users to identify key usability issues and gather feedback for improving the game's mechanics and design. These insights were implemented to enhance user comfort and game interaction.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive AR Gameplay:** Players engage with augmented elements in real-world environments.
- **Improved Comfort:** Adjustments to head movement and visual design minimize discomfort and fatigue during play.
- **User-Centered Design:** Feedback-driven improvements ensure better interaction, clearer mechanics, and a more enjoyable user experience.
- **Tutorial and Visual Cues:** New players are guided through the game's core mechanics for smoother onboarding.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/bkurtulmus/Enhancing-User-Experiences-in-Augmented-Reality-Gaming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd Enhancing-User-Experiences-in-Augmented-Reality-Gaming
    ```

3. Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Android Studio).

4. Build and run the project on an AR-compatible device.

## Usage

- Ensure your device is AR-enabled.
- Launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to start playing.
- Use the tutorial mode to familiarize yourself with the game mechanics before diving into gameplay.

## Future Improvements

- Further enhancements to user comfort and interaction design.
- Expanded levels with more complex AR elements and challenges.
- Ongoing refinement of the tutorial and user interface based on feedback from future usability tests.
